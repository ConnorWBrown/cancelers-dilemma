# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Code Splitting

## Using the Minikube backend (convenience)

If your backend is running in Minikube (namespace `cancelers-dilemma` with Service name `backend`) you can start the frontend dev server with the proper backend URL injected automatically.

This script queries Minikube for the forwarded localhost URL (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:49831) and starts the dev server with REACT_APP_API_URL set.

Run from the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm run start-minikube
```

You can also run the command manually to inspect the URL first:

```bash
# prints e.g. http://127.0.0.1:49831
minikube service -n cancelers-dilemma backend --url

# then start the dev server with that URL
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49831 npm start
```

Notes:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` is read at build/start time by Create React App. When using `npm start` or `npm run start-minikube` the dev server picks up the environment variable from your shell.
- If you prefer to use the cluster NodePort (nodeIP:nodePort) instead, set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to that address.
